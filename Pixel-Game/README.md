# Pyxis 

Pyxis, as it is now, is a multiplayer falling sand simulation. It is my favorite personal project so far, and probably my best work. Things still need work, but it is pretty stable!

 ## Key Features:
* #### Multiplayer
* #### Infinite World
* #### Dynamic / Static Rigid Bodies with runtime deformation


## Notes
Server's port is 60000, and everything is run on TCP at the moment

Clients aren't yet able to wait for eachother, so the client farthest in the lead has to wait on the one furthest behind. will be fixed soon!
